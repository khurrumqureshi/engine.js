Engine.js
=========
The scriptable task engine

What is Engine.js?
------------------

Engine.js is a framework for extending web applications to allow users
to write their own server-side javascript code to interact with the
application. Engine.js lets users create their own functionality
within the application.

When you integrate Engine.js with your web application you must
explicitly determine what set of functions users can call from their
custom scripts. Implicitly, all Javascript
[built-in objects](http://es5.github.com/#x4.2) are available (though
you can explicitly re-define their definitions if you choose to).

Engine.js currently uses Node.js for script evaluation. It has a
client library for Node.js (bundled). Ruby and PHP client libraries
are planned.

See the
[Overview](https://github.com/rehanift/engine.js/wiki/Overview) and
[Documentation](https://github.com/rehanift/engine.js/wiki/Documentation)
pages for more information.

### Dependencies
   - Linux or OS X
   - Node.js (tested with v0.6.7)
   - NPM
   - ZeroMQ (2.1)
     - OS X: `brew install zeromq`
     - Linux: [See 0mq INSTALL](https://raw.github.com/zeromq/zeromq2-1/master/INSTALL)

### Quick Start
  - Install the library: `npm install engine.js`
  
  - Start the server: `node script/server.js`

  - Write your code    

	```javascript
    var engine = require("engine.js").engine;
    var client = engine.client.create();
        
    var task = client.createTask();
    task.setContext("(function(locals){ return { add: function(a,b){ return a+b } } })");
    task.setLocals({});
    task.setCode('add(1,2)');        
      
    task.on('eval', function(data){
      console.log('your code was evaluated as:', data); //#=> 3   
    });

    task.run();
	```
      
  - Profit!

### Demo
Included in `examples/dashboard` is a demo [Express](http://expressjs.com/) application.

You must have both `Express` and `Socket.io` installed

	npm install express
	npm install socket.io
	
You can then run: `node examples/dashboard/app.js` and open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`

### Future Plans
  - Support for other sandboxable scripting languages (ie. Lua)
  - Support other Javascript runtimes (ie. RingoJS)
  - Client's in other languages (Java, Python, etc. Basically any language that has [ZeroMQ bindings](http://www.zeromq.org/bindings:_start))
  - Benchmarks
  - Demo applications
